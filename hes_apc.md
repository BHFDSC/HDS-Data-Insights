## HES APC

### Description
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) contains records of all admissions, appointments and attendances at NHS hospitals in England. Records in the HES Admitted Patient Care (HES APC) database are called ‘hospital episodes’, and each hospital episode relates to a period of care for a patient under a single consultant within one hospital provider. A stay in hospital from admission to discharge is called a ‘spell’ and can be made up of one or more episodes of care.
